# Introduction

GLAcier Feature Tracking testkit (GLAFT) is a Python package for assessing and benchmarking feature-tracked glacier velocity maps derived from satellite imagery. To be compatible with as many feature-tracking tools as possible, GLAFT analyzes velocity maps (and optional reliability files used as weight) and calculates two metrics based on statistics and ice flow dynamics. Along with GLAFTâ€™s visualization tools, users can intercompare the quality of velocity maps processed by different methods and parameter sets. In the [GLAFT publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-38), we further provide a guideline for optimizing glacier velocity maps by comparing the calculated metrics to an ideal threshold value.

GLAFT is an open sourced project and is hosted on Github (https://github.com/whyjz/GLAFT). All documentation and cloud-executable demos are deployed as Jupyter Book pages (https://whyjz.github.io/GLAFT/). 

## Installation

**Try GLAFT without installing**: We recommend running our [Quick Start notebook on MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/whyjz/glacier-ft-test/master?urlpath=tree/jupyter-book/doc/quickstart.ipynb).

**For cloud access**: We recommend using the [Ghub portal to launch GLAFT](https://theghub.org/tools/glaft/status) (registration required).

**For local installation**: GLAFT is available on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`. 

```
pip install glaft
```
